## Your turn 1

For each of the following 4 datasets, look at the correlation between `exposure` and `covariate`: 

* `causal_collider`
* `causal_confounding`
* `causal_mediator`
* `causal_m_bias`


```{r}

```

For each of the above 4 datasets, create a scatterplot looking at the relationship between `exposure` and `outcome`

```{r}

```

For each of the above 4 datasets, fit a linear model to examine the relationship between the `exposure` and the `outcome`

```{r}

```

## Your turn 2

For each of the following 4 datasets, fit a linear linear model examining the relationship between `outcome_followup` and `exposure_baseline` adjusting for `covariate_baseline`: 

* `causal_collider_time`
* `causal_confounding_time`
* `causal_mediator_time`
* `causal_m_bias_time`

```{r}

```
